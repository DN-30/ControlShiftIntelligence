This is an attempt by 5 dudes with no prior knowledge about anything related to AI to create a working game in which the boss adapts to the user's playstyle after each game and plays accordingly.

Imagine playing a game where the boss is like maharoga as it levels up just like in Solo Levelling.

It is a topdown type game which engages the user to fight the boss.
